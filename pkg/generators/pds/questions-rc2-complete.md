# Questions RC2

* Before doing more finetuning

* Before scaling it up to `real estate` and `infrastructure`

## Layout

* Desktop layout fine?

* Sliders get very squeezed; still fine?

* This layout is too wide for mobile

## Slider

* There is no _empty_ state;  
  There is always some `preselected` value :-(

  * grey thumb on init state?

* Intervals or points?  
    Should really all sliders designate an interval between ticks?   
    If not, please ad column to the Excel specifiation: [interval|point]  
    Slider thumbs as arrow between interval ticks?

## Not yet working

* Vertical alignment of tranch names

* Validation of summing up (adding up to 100%)

* Some scales are incomplete; ticks are missing

* Slider display is often too narrow

* Slider display shows interval, not point;  
  Yet slider _thumb_ aligned to point; not yet to interval
