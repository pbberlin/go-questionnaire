Welcome to the ZEW Private Debt Survey, a new quarterly survey covering developments on the European Private Debt
markets. In this survey, we will refer to your Corporate Direct Lending, Real Estate Debt and Infrastructure Debt
investments and will address quantitative and qualitative aspects of your investments and investment strategies.

<p>
We highly appreciate your participation in this survey. With your answers, you are contributing to the collection of
richer data around private credit investments strengthening the private debt markets and supporting investors to make
qualified investment decisions. We would therefore like to ask you to fill out the online questionnaire as completely as
possible.

<p>
As a participant, you will receive a detailed report from us with aggregated and anonymous survey results after each
survey round.

<p>
All responses to this survey will be treated as strictly confidential and in compliance with the GDPR. We will only pass
on aggregated, anonymized responses to our cooperation partner Prime Capital AG, who will write the report. Only if you
give your explicit consent, we will also pass on your individual answers to Prime Capital AG in non-anonymized form. In
this case no personal data is passed on to Prime Capital AG, only the company name and the answers given in the survey will be forwarded.
Prime Capital AG will not pass on the data received and will only process this data within the scope of the business
activities of the Investment Advisory & Solutions division, in particular for the purposes of database enrichment in the
context of manager selection or for the purpose of deriving capital market assumptions. All details regarding data
